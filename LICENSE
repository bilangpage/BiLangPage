the Free Software Foundation, either version 3 of the License, or
(at your option) any later version.

This program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,
but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of
MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  See the

                    TERMS AND CONDITIONS

0. Definitions.

"This License" refers to version 3 of the GNU Affero General Public License.

"Copyright" also means copyright-like laws that apply to other kinds of works.

"The Program" refers to any copyrightable work licensed under this License.
Each licensee is addressed as "you".

"Licensees" and "recipients" may be individuals or organizations.

To "modify" a work means to copy from or adapt all or part of the work in
a fashion requiring copyright permission, other than the making of an exact copy.
The resulting work is called a "modified version" of the earlier work or a
work "based on" the earlier work.

A "covered work" means either the unmodified Program or a work based on
the Program.

To "propagate" a work means to do anything with it that, without permission,
would make you directly or secondarily liable for infringement under applicable
copyright law, except executing it on a computer or modifying a private copy.
Propagation includes copying, distribution (with or without modification),
making available to the public, and in some countries other activities as well.

To "convey" a work means any kind of propagation that enables other parties
to make or receive copies. Mere interaction with a user through a computer
network, with no transfer of a copy, is not conveying.

An interactive user interface displays "Appropriate Legal Notices" to the
extent that it includes a convenient and prominently visible feature that
(1) displays an appropriate copyright notice, and (2) tells the user that
there is no warranty for the work (except to the extent that warranties
are provided), that licensees may convey the work under this License,
and how to view a copy of this License.

1. Source Code.

The "source code" for a work means the preferred form of the work for
making modifications to it. "Object code" means any non-source form of a work.

A "Standard Interface" means an interface that either is an official
standard defined by a recognized standards body, or, in the case of
interfaces specified for a particular programming language, one that is
widely used among developers working in that language.

2. Basic Permissions.

All rights granted under this License are granted for the term of copyright
on the Program, and are irrevocable provided the stated conditions are met.
This License explicitly affirms your unlimited permission to run the
unmodified Program.

3. Protecting Users' Legal Rights From Anti-Circumvention Law.

No covered work shall be deemed part of an effective technological measure
under any applicable law fulfilling obligations under article 11 of the
WIPO copyright treaty adopted on 20 December 1996, or similar laws
prohibiting or restricting circumvention of such measures.

4. Conveying Verbatim Copies.

You may convey verbatim copies of the Program's source code as you receive
it, in any medium, provided that you conspicuously and appropriately
publish on each copy an appropriate copyright notice.

5. Network Use.

The GNU Affero General Public License permits making a modified version and
letting the public access it on a server without ever releasing its
source code to the public.

However, if you modify the Program, your modified version must prominently
offer all users interacting with it remotely through a computer network
an opportunity to receive the source code of your version by providing
access to the source code from a network server at no charge, through
some standard or customary means of facilitating copying of software.

6. Revised Versions of this License.

The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions of the
GNU Affero General Public License from time to time. Such new versions will
be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to
address new problems or concerns.

7. Disclaimer of Warranty.

THERE IS NO WARRANTY FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE
LAW. EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR
OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE PROGRAM "AS IS" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND,
EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. THE
ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM IS WITH YOU.
SHOULD THE PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY
SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.

8. Limitation of Liability.

IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING WILL
ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MODIFIES AND/OR CONVEYS THE
PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY
GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE
USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM.

9. Acceptance Not Required for Having Copies.

You are not required to accept this License in order to receive or run a
copy of the Program.

10. Automatic Licensing of Downstream Recipients.

Each time you convey a covered work, the recipient automatically receives
a license from the original licensors, to run, modify and propagate that
work, subject to this License.
